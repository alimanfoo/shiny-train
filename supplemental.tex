	\textit{IR gene} = functionally validated insecticide resistance gene; \textit{novel locus} = locus with substantial evidence for recent positive selection in one or more populations in this study, not previously studied or associated with insecticide resistance in \textit{An. gambiae} or \textit{An. coluzzii}. 
	%	
	H1, H12, H123 are summaries of the haplotype frequency spectrum in moving windows, as defined by \citet{Garud2015}. 
	%
	$|iHS|$ denotes the absolute value of the integrated haplotype score, as defined by \citet{Voight2006}; each marker summarises data in half-overlapping windows of 200 SNPs; $P_{n}$ denotes the $n$th percentile. 
	%
	$XP-EHH$ denotes the cross-population extended haplotype homozygosity as defined by \citet{Sabeti2007}; 	each marker summarises data in half-overlapping windows of 500 SNPs; $P_{n}$ denotes the $n$th percentile.
	%
	$PBS$ denotes the normalized population branching statistic as defined by \citet{Crawford2017}, calculated in moving windows of @@N SNPs; values have been centred and scaled as defined in Methods.

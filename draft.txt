Introduction
# Malaria vectors are under new, complex and intense selection pressures
Interrupting malaria transmission remains a major goal for public health programmes in sub-Saharan Africa [WHO2015GTS]. Unfortunately, malaria control has become locked into an evolutionary arms race, with research, development and policy all fighting to keep pace with the emergence and spread of new forms of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors [Hemingway2016; WHO2012GPIRM]. Alongside a massive expansion of malaria vector control programmes since the turn of the millenium [Cibulskis2016; Bhatt2015; WHO2019WMR], human population distributions and patterns of land use have changed dramatically, including rapid urbanisation [Awumbila2017; OECD2020] and the expansion and intensification of agriculture [Otsuka2014; Binswanger-Mkhize2017]. Thus the environment in which natural malaria vector populations seek food and suitable habitats throughout their multi-stage life cycle has radically altered in recent decades, generating new and complex evolutionary pressures. Furthermore, multiple mosquito species are competent malaria vectors in sub-Saharan Africa, and selection pressures may differ between species due to differences in their physiology and behaviour [Gillies1968]. Several of the major malaria vector species also have large geographical ranges spanning a variety of contrasting ecological settings and environmental conditions [Sinka2012; Wiebe2017]. Selection pressures may thus be highly heterogeneous throughout these ranges, and different populations of any given species may be evolving in different ways. Studying these recent evolutionary events at a genomic level, in multiple malaria vector species and geographical locations, provides an opportunity to support malaria vector surveillance efforts, generating new data on how vector populations are adapting in response to public health interventions. It is also of fundamental biological interest, providing a model system for the study of eukaryotic evolution under strong anthropogenic selection pressures. 


# Selection pressure due to pyrethroid ITNs
At the heart of this transformation in the malaria vector's natural environment is the massive scale-up of campaigns performing mass-distribution of insecticide-treated bed-nets (ITNs) [WHO2005WIN; RBM2008GMAP; WHO2017LLIN; Bhatt2015; Okumu2020]. More than two billion ITNs have been delivered in sub-Saharan Africa since the turn of the millennium [AMP2020; RBM2020], with the proportion of the population at risk sleeping under an ITN increasing from less than 2% to more than 50% of the population by 2015 [Cibulskis2016; Bhatt2015], although coverage varies substantially between countries [WHO2019WMR]. All ITN products currently approved for public health use are treated with a pyrethroid insecticide [WHO2020PQVC], which comprises the primary active ingredient, serving both to repel mosquitoes and to kill mosquitoes that come into physical contact with the net [Okumu2020]. ITNs targets malaria vector species that are highly anthropophilic and prefer to seek blood meals from humans while they sleep at night, including the sibling species Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles coluzzii, which are the dominant malaria vectors throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa [Gillies1968; Coetzee2013]. Unsurprisingly, pyrethroid resistance has become widespread in these species and increased in intensity over the time period of ITN scale-up [Hemingway2016; Hancock2020]. With pyrethroid ITNs continuing to serve as the mainstay of malaria vector control efforts into the next decade, understanding and monitoring the evolution of pyrethroid resistance is a top priority. 


# Unknowns about evolution of pyrethroid resistance
Pyrethroid resistance has been extensively studied in malaria vector species both in the lab and the field, and several molecular mechanisms of resistance are known [Hemingway2016]. Yet there remain substantial and surprising gaps in our knowledge of the genetic changes that have occurred in natural An. gambiae and An. coluzzii populations in response to pyrethroid selection pressure. For example, adaptations affecting cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are known to have occurred in some mosquito populations, inducing pyrethroid resistance by increasing the metabolism of insecticide molecules within the mosquito [Ranson2016; Hemingway2016]. This form of metabolic resistance is perceived as a significant threat to the efficacy of ITNs [Churcher2016; WHO2017PBOLLIN], and new ITN products that combine a pyrethroid with the CYP-inhibitor piperonyl butoxide (PBO) are now being procured and distributed at scale in several countries, despite higher costs and limited data on efficacy [Okumu2020]. There are currently 108 CYP genes annotated in the Anopheles gambiae genome [Giraldo-Calderon2015; AgamP4.12], of which several have been shown to have the potential to metabolise pyrethroids, but it is still not clear which CYP genes are the primary drivers of adaptation to pyrethroids in the field [Mohammed2017]. It is also not clear which vector populations currently carry CYP-mediated pyrethroid resistance adaptations, and whether the same CYP genes are involved across multiple populations or not [Mohammed2017]. Furthermore, other classes of enzyme also have the potential to metabolise pyrethroids, but their role in the evolution of pyrethroid resistance is unclear [Adolfi2019]. Additionally, entirely new molecular mechanisms of pyrethroid resistance have recently been discovered [Ingham2020], opening up the possibility of a much larger adaptive landscape than previously appreciated.


# Other insecticides in use in public health and agriculture
Malaria vectors may also encounter a range of other insecticides during their lifetime, either because of malaria vector control interventions or agricultural use. Indoor residual spraying of insecticides (IRS) has also been scaled up as a public health intervention against malaria since the turn of the millennium [WHO2019WMR; Bhatt2015]. IRS coverage has not reached the same level as ITNs, but has nevertheless had a measurable impact on malaria transmission [Bhatt2015], with 10.1% of the population at risk protected by IRS in 2010, although this has fallen back to 4.5% in 2019 [WHO2019WMR]. There is even greater spatial heterogeneity in IRS coverage than for ITNs, with IRS generally reserved for use in high transmission regions [WHO2019WMR]. Part of the reduction in IRS coverage in recent years can be attributed to the introduction of more expensive insecticides. In 2010, most IRS programmes used pyrethroids, but by 2018 many had switched to use organophosphates because of pyrethroid resistance, although pyrethroids, carbamates and organochlorines all remain in use [WHO2019WMR]. All insecticides used in public health either have been or continue to be used in agriculture, and a major open question remains whether agricultural pesticide use is driving selection for insecticide resistance in malaria vectors [Georghiou1990; Nkya2013; Philbert2014; Reid2016]. As IRS programmes continue to switch away from pyrethroids to use organophosphates such as pirimiphos-methyl or the recently approved neonicotinoid clothianidin, it is vital to understand what if any adaptations to these compounds exist in malaria vector populations, either because of prior use in agriculture or because of prior public health use of insecticides with a similar mode of action [Fouet2020].


# Segue to genome-wide selection scans
Given the variety and heterogeneity of these new selection pressures, evolution is likely to be occurring at multiple loci throughout the genomes of malaria vector species. The availability of data from whole-genome sequencing of malaria vectors thus provides an opportunity to study the full genomic landscape of recent selection, to discover new adaptations to insecticide resistance, and to compare the genomic profile of adaptation between different species and populations [Fouet2018]. A number of statistical methods have been developed for performing genome-wide selection scans using high quality whole genome variation data from individuals sampled from natural populations [Oleksyk2010; Haasl2015; Vatsiou2016; Pavlidis2017; Booker2017]. These methods work in different ways, but all leverage the fact that recent positive selection leaves a characteristic signature at affected loci, which can be detected against a genomic background where the majority of genes have not experienced recent positive selection. For example, H12 [Garud2015] detects a localised decrease in haplotype diversity; IHS [Voight2006] and XPEHH [Sabeti2007] detect a localised increase in haplotype sharing, either within or between populations respectively; and PBS [Yi2010; Crawford2017] detects a localised increase in genetic differentiation between populations. These methods are not perfect, having varying power to detect different types of selection under different population demographic scenarios [Haasl2015; Vatsiou2016; Pavlidis2017; Booker2017]. They may also correctly detect a signal of selection but fail to provide enough precision to narrow down the target of selection to a single gene. Nevertheless, genome-wide selection scans can provide valuable information about genomic regions under selection, within which candidate genes can be identified and prioritised for further study.


# Previous selection scans in Anopheles
The largest and most comprehensive genomic data resources currently available for the study of recent selection in malaria vectors have been generated by the Anopheles gambiae 1000 Genomes (Ag1000G) Project [Ag1000G2017]. The first phase of the Ag1000G Project generated high quality SNP calls and phased haplotypes from 765 individual mosquitoes sampled from the wild in 8 African countries [Ag1000G2017]. As part of the analyses of those data, we ran preliminary genome-wide selection scans using the H12 and XPEHH statistics. Those scans revealed some clear and striking signals of selection coinciding with known insecticide resistance genes, as well as a number of signals spanning genome regions not previously studied in An. gambiae or An. coluzzii. Some selection signals were clearly present across multiple geographical locations and species, but some were private to a single population or country. In addition to Ag1000G, several other studies have recently performed genome-wide selection scans in malaria vectors. Weedall et al. [Weedall2020] studied populations of An. funestus from seven African countries using pooled-template whole genome sequencing, and found three strong signals of selection spanning insecticide resistance loci, with selection profiles contrasting between geographical regions. Bergey et al. [Bergey2019] studied An. gambiae from Uganda using whole-genome sequencing, comparing the mainland with islands in Lake Victoria, also finding several strong selection signals, with some heterogeneity among the different island populations. Kamdem et al. [Kamdem2017] used reduced-representation sequencing to study An. gambiae and An. coluzzii in Cameroon, finding strong signals of selection with some contrast between urban and rural populations. Main et al. [Main2015] analysed data from whole-genome sequencing of An. coluzzii from Mali, finding a selection signal spanning the Cyp9k1 gene occurring in samples following the scale-up of ITN usage in the region. Vontas et al. [Vontas2018] subsequently showed via gene expression studies that evolution of Cyp9k1 had occurred in An. coluzzii on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea, in response to combined use of pyrethroids in IRS and ITN programmes, confirming that recent adaptations are presenting operational challenges for vector control programmes. @@TODO Rdl and 3R:40Mb [Lawniczak2010]. @@TODO Tep1 [White2011].


# About this paper
Here we extend our previous analysis of recent selection in the Ag1000G data, to systematically explore and characterise the genomic landscape of recent positive selection in An. gambiae and An. coluzzii populations from 13 African countries. We integrate results from multiple genome-wide selection scans, and compare selection profiles between species and geographical locations. We also describe an online resource where all selection signals can be searched and browsed, and investigate the strongest selection signals to identify candidate genes driving novel forms of insecticide resistance.

Genome-wide selection scans
# Summary of the input data
We performed genome-wide selection scans using nucleotide variation data from phase 2 of the Ag1000G Project, derived from whole-genome deep sequencing of individual wild-caught mosquitoes using Illumina high-throughput technology [Ag1000G2020]. These data comprise high quality genotype calls at 57,837,885 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites distributed throughout the four autosomal chromosome arms (2R, 2L, 3R, 3L) and the X chromosome. The data also include haplotypes phased at biallelic SNPs using a combination of read-backed and statistical phasing, and we used either unphased genotypes or phased haplotypes for our selection scans as required by the scanning method. From the 1,142 individual wild-caught mosquitoes available, which we initially defined 16 populations by species (either An. gambiae or An. coluzzii) and country of origin. Mosquitoes from Guinea-Bissau and Kenya both had uncertain species status, but previous analyses found no evidence for genetic structure within each of these collections [Ag1000G2020], and we therefore initially included Guinea-Bissau and Kenya as two further populations. The Kenyan population, however, exhibited extremely low levels of genetic diversity across the whole genome when compared with other populations, consistent with a strong recent bottleneck [Ag1000G2017]. In exploratory analyses we found that this low genome-wide diversity substantially reduced the resolution and increased the noise in genome-wide selection scans, and therefore we excluded the Kenyan population from further selection analyses. We also previously found evidence for some structure among the Cameroon An. gambiae mosquitoes, associated with ecological differences between the different collection sites [Ag1000G2017]. We therefore included only the Cameroon mosquitoes from the savannah collection sites, which appeared to comprise a well-mixed population. Finally we excluded Guinea An. coluzzii due to low sample size. Overall we analysed 14 populations, with sample size ranging from N=@@ (@@which) to N=@@ (@@which).


# Summary of the selection scans we performed
For each population we performed genome-wide selection scans using two independent statistical methods, H12 [Garud2015] and IHS [Voight2006]. We also performed XPEHH scans [Sabeti2007] with selected pairs of populations, and normalised PBS scans [Crawford2017] with selected triplets of populations. The XPEHH and PBS methods are designed to identify genome locations where selection is acting in some populations but not others, and we therefore chose combinations of populations for these scans to allow for comparisons between species and between geographically distant locations. All together, this comprised a total of @@N genome-wide selection scans. Each of these scans produced a set of test statistics, whose values correspond to the strength of evidence for positive selection, either at individual SNPs, or within small genomic windows. As a precursor to further analysis and identification of selection signals, we plotted these statistics over the genome (Supplemental Figs. S1-S14).
Selection signals at functionally-validated insecticide resistance genes
A visual inspection of these selection scans revealed a number of genome regions with high values for selection statistics, including regions that coincided with six functionally-validated insecticide resistance genes: Gste2 (AGAP009194), Cyp6p3 (AGAP002865), Cyp9k1 (AGAP000818), Vgsc (AGAP004707), Gaba (AGAP006028) and Ace1 (AGAP001356). For each of these six genes, we observed evidence for recent selection in results from different scanning methods, and in multiple populations, providing multiple dimensions of replication. These insecticide resistance genes thus provided valuable positive controls, and we studied them in detail to learn more about the character of true signals of recent positive selection.
Gste2
Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a diverse family of metabolic enzymes involved in the detoxification of xenobiotic substances. In An. gambiae, GSTs were initially associated with DDT resistance [Prapanthadara1993], with a major locus of DDT resistance mapping to Chromosome 3 [Ranson2000] found to contain a cluster of insect-specific GSTs with high DDT dehydrochlorinase activity and elevated expression in resistant mosquito strains [Ranson2001; Ding2003]. Amino acid substitutions in Gste2, a member of this gene cluster, confer resistance to DDT in An. gambiae [Mitchell2014] and An. funestus [Riveron2014], and elevated expression of Gste2 confers resistance to DDT and organophosphates in An. gambiae [Adolfi2019]. We previously reported that the Gste gene cluster is a hotspot for gene copy number amplification within the Ag1000G phase 2 cohort, with CNV alleles segregating at high frequency in several populations, providing a genetic basis for increased expression of these enzymes [Lucas2019]. In our genome-wide selection scans we found evidence for recent selection at the Gste locus on Chromosome 3 in nine populations (An. gambiae from Burkina Faso, Guinea, Ghana, Cameroon, Uganda, Gabon; An. coluzzii from Burkina Faso, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire) (Supplementary Figs. S15-S18). In these nine populations, at least one CNV allele or the Gste2 I114T allele was present above 5% frequency, except for Ghana An. gambiae where no CNV alleles were found and Gste2 I114T was present at lower frequency (4%). In the remaining five populations without evidence for recent selection, only Angola An. coluzzii had CNV alleles and none contained Gste2 I114T. Thus there was a strong concordance between evidence for recent positive selection and known validated or plausible insecticide resistance variants.
Cyp6p3
Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) comprise another diverse enzyme family that catalyse the oxidation and metabolism of both xenobiotic and endogenous compounds. There are currently 108 CYP genes annotated in the An. gambiae genome  [Giraldo-Calderon2015; AgamP4.12], including several that have been shown to metabolise insecticides [Mohammed2017]. Cyp6p3 occurs on Chromosome 2 within a cluster of 10 CYP genes, and was originally associated with pyrethroid resistance in a study of An. gambiae in Ghana, which also showed its capability to metabolise both permethrin and deltamethrin [Muller2008]. Experimentally increased expression of Cyp6p3 causes resistance to both pyrethroids and carbamates in An. gambiae [Adolfi2019]. No genetic markers of insecticide resistance have yet been validated at this locus, but similar to the Gste locus, we previously reported that the Cyp6p/aa gene cluster is a hotspot for gene copy number amplification within the Ag1000G phase 2 cohort [Lucas2019]. In our genome-wide selection scans we found evidence for recent selection at this locus in ten populations (An. gambiae from Burkina faso, Guinea, Ghana, Cameroon, Uganda; An. coluzzii from Burkina Faso, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Angola; The Gambia) (Supplementary Figs. S19-S22). CNVs were above 5% frequency in four of the populations where we also observed evidence for recent selection (An. gambiae from Uganda; An. coluzzii from Burkina Faso, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire), but not in the remaining six populations, suggesting other variants are driving selection that remain to be discovered.
Cyp9k1
Cyp9k1 is a cytochrome P450 gene occurring on the An. gambiae X chromosome. Main et al. [Main2015] found a selection signal spanning the Cyp9k1 gene occurring in An. coluzzii in Mali following the scale-up of ITN usage. Vontas et al. [Vontas2018] subsequently showed via gene expression studies that evolution of Cyp9k1 had occurred in An. coluzzii on Bioko Island in response to combined use of pyrethroids in IRS and ITN programmes. The same study showed that Cyp9k1 metabolises the pyrethroid deltamethrin, but also pyriproxyfen, a non-pyrethroid insecticide only recently introduced into public health via dual active ingredient ITNs. Similar to the Cyp6aa/p locus, no genetic markers of insecticide resistance have been validated at this locus, but we previously reported that Cyp9k1 is a hotspot for gene copy number amplification within the Ag1000G phase 2 cohort [Lucas2019]. In our genome-wide selection scans we found evidence for recent selection at Cyp9k1 in eleven populations (An. gambiae from Burkina Faso, Guinea, Cameroon, Uganda, Bioko, Gabon; An. coluzzii from Burkina Faso, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire; The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau) (Supplementary Figs. S23-26). CNVs were above 5% in six of these populations, and present but at lower frequencies in two further populations with evidence of selection.
Vgsc
The voltage-gated sodium channel (Vgsc) gene encodes a vital protein in the insect nervous system which is the physiological binding target of DDT and pyrethroid insecticides [Dong2014]. Amino acid substitutions in this gene have been found to cause resistance to pyrethroids and/or DDT across a diversity of insect taxa [Dong2014]. In An. gambiae, an L995F[1] substitution was initially found in West African populations, with frequency closely correlated with pyrethroid resistance [Martinez-Torres1998]. A second substitution, L995S, was then found in Kenyan An. gambiae and associated with DDT and pyrethroid resistance, and shown to have been present in those populations prior to any use of pyrethroid ITNs [Ranson2001]. Subsequently, Jones et al. [Jones2012] found a third substitution, N1570Y, occurring exclusively on haplotypes carrying L995F, in West and Central African populations of both An. gambiae and An. coluzzii. N1570Y has been shown experimentally to substantially enhance pyrethroid resistance above that provided by L995F alone [Wang2014]. Across Africa, the two codon 995 substitutions are highly correlated with pyrethroid and DDT resistance [Hancock2018]. In our genome-wide selection scans we found evidence for recent selection at Vgsc in ten populations (An. gambiae from Burkina Faso, Ghana, Guinea, Cameroon, Gabon, Uganda; An. coluzzii from Burkina Faso, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Angola) (Supplementary Figs. S27-S29). These ten populations correspond exactly to those in which we found either L995F or L995S, including several populations where these substitutions have become fixed. While the L995F/S substitutions appear to be the main drivers of selection at this locus, we reported a more detailed analysis of genetic variation at the Vgsc locus elsewhere, including evidence for novel resistance driver substitutions in some populations, and substantial molecular evolution secondary to selection of the L995F allele [Clarkson2018].  
Gaba
Resistance to dieldrin, an organochloride insecticide, was the first documented instance of insecticide resistance in Anopheles gambiae sensu lato [Elliott1956; Davidson1956]. Dieldrin targets another component of the insect nervous system, the gamma-aminobutyric acid recept subunit, encoded by the Gaba gene on Chromosome 2, also known as the resistance to dieldrin (Rdl) locus. Dieldrin use ceased in the 1970s, but resistance has remained persistent in natural Anopheles populations for decades afterwards [Du2005]. Two amino acid substitutions, A296G and A296S, conferring resistance to dieldrin, have been found in An. gambiae and An. coluzzii [Du2005; Lawniczak2010]. These two substitutions are present in multiple populations within the Ag1000G phase 2 cohort, and we reported a detailed analysis of this locus elsewhere, describing how each of these substitutions appears to have spread via a hard selective sweep, followed by introgression between species and inversion karyotypes [Grau-Bové2020a]. In our genome-wide selection scans we found evidence for positive selection at Gaba in eight populations (An. gambiae from Burkina Faso, Guinea, Ghana, Gabon, Bioko; An. coluzzii from Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana) (Supplementary Figs. S30-S32). All eight of these populations carry either A296S or A296G at 35% frequency or above. A296G was also present at high frequency in Angola An. coluzzii and Cameroon An. gambiae, but evidence for recent selection in those populations was weak in all selection scans.
Ace1
Organophosphate and carbamate insecticides function by binding to and inhibiting the acetylcholinesterase enzyme, encoded by the Ace1 gene on Chromosome 3, which under normal function catalyses the breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine to terminate synaptic transmission. A single amino acid substitution, G280S, is present in multiple populations of An. gambiae and An. coluzzii and confers resistance to both organophosphates and carbamates [Weill2003; Weill2004]. In addition, copy number amplification of Ace1 is also present in these species and is tightly linked with the G280S substitution [Djogbenou2008 and refs in Grau-Bové2020b]. Both G280S and Ace1 duplications are present in multiple populations in the Ag1000G phase 2 cohort, and we reported a detailed analysis elsewhere, describing how these two mutations occur on a common haplotype that arose in An. gambiae and subsequently introgressed into An. coluzzii [Grau-Bové2020b]. In our genome-wide selection scans we found evidence for positive selection in Cote d'Ivoire An. coluzzii and Ghana An. gambiae (Supplementary Figs. S33-S36). These two populations were at the highest frequency for G280S and Ace1 duplications [Grau-Bové2020b]. These mutations were also present at lower frequency in four other populations, but evidence for selection was weak in all selection scans. 
Genome-wide discovery of selection signals
Algorithm design for signal discovery and selection mapping
From our analysis of selection signals at validated insecticide resistance genes, we made the following general observations.


Almost all selection signals displayed a clear peak architecture, with a maximum (peak) value close to the target gene, and values decaying to background levels both upstream and downstream of the gene. In the H12 selection signals, values on either side of the target gene appeared to decay asymptotically, and we tested this formally by fitting a peak model with an exponential function on both flanks to H12 values at several loci in several populations via nonlinear least-squares regression (Supplementary Figs. @@). We quantified the support for the exponential peak models by also fitting a null constant model (i.e., no peak) and computing the difference in Akaike Information Criterion (𝚫i) between the two models. @@TODO report results of exponential peak fitting to H12@@. The generally good fit of these exponential models is consistent with theoretical predictions for a locus under recent positive selection, where genetic hitchhiking of neutral variants surrounding the locus is expected to occur due to linkage disequilibrium, and the probability of linkage is an exponential function of the genetic distance between the selected and hitchhiking variants [MaynardSmith1974]. It is also consistent with the work of Wiener and Pong-Wong [Wiener2011] who showed that exponential functions can be fitted to heterozygosity data on either flank of a selected locus via nonlinear regression, and that this can be used as a tool for identifying and mapping loci under selection. 


@@TODO peaks were broad. Also in some cases skewed, i.e., asymmetric. Particularly Vgsc. But for Vgsc, found could be corrected to some extent by assumptions about recombination rate in heterochromatin. But shows that theoretical expectation of exponential decay could be affected by a number of factors, lack of fine scale recombination maps, local variation in recombination rate. Also other issues like soft sweeps, with peak being aggregate of two or more sweeps. Variation in population size and/or strength of selection could also affect. Hard to generalise analytically, but we took a pragmatic approach and tried fitting a range of alternative peak models to H12 selection signals, allowing for some skew (asymmetry), and using different peak functions. In a number of cases we found a model that fitted substantially better (@@N) than a simple, symmetrical, exponential peak model.


@@TODO broken peaks, scattered values falling below the exponential peak model fit. Assume this is a form of noise in the data, due to genotype calling or phasing issues.

Selection signals were noticeably broader at the Cyp9k1 locus, with signal gaps immediately upstream of Cyp9k1 due to gaps in the reference genome and other accessibility issues, which may account for the lower agreement between scanning methods.
 
The role of Gste2 in pyrethroid resistance remains unclear [Adolfi2019], although mutations in this gene have been associated with increased survival following exposure to pyrethroid ITNs in An. funestus [Menze2020]


For example, peaks were evident at the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) gene, which is the target site for pyrethroid insecticides and where amino acid substitutions are known to confer resistant to pyrethroids [@@REF]. A number of peaks were centred on a cluster of CYP genes on chromosome arm 2R, including Cyp6p3 which has been shown cause metabolic resistance to @@WHAT. We also observed peaks centred on a cluster of glutathione S-transferase genes on chromosome arm 3R, including Gste2 which has been shown to cause metabolic resistance to @@WHAT [@@REFs]. For each of these three loci, we observed clear peaks in results from different scanning methods, and in multiple sample groups, providing replication across both methodology and population.

@@TODO mention previous genome-wide studies of recent selection in gambiae@@. As part of the Anopheles gambiae 1000 genomes project, we generated high quality SNP calls and phased haplotypes for ~~N mosquitoes sampled from @M countries. Although the dates of sampling vary, with some populations sampled closer to the turn of the millennium prior to major scale-ups of vector control, and some populations sampled later. Most recent sampling is 2012, thus does not provide a contemporary view. Nonetheless provides the only resource of genome-wide data from multiple populations, valuable to explore and characterise adaptations.


We previously ran selection scans using two statistics on the phase 1 populations, which showed clearly visible signals of selection at a number of genes known or strongly implicated in insecticide resistance. Here we expand on those analyses, by applying additional scanning statistics, and by systematically extracting and cataloguing all selection signals found, alongside information on genes at selection loci likely to be involved in insecticide resistance. We describe an online resource where all selection signals can be searched and browsed, and characterise the strongest selection signals at novel loci providing the strongest candidates for insecticide resistance adaptations. 


In the second phase of the Ag1000G project we generated high quality SNP calls and phased haplotypes from 1,142 individual mosquitoes sampled from the wild in 13 African countries [Ag1000G2020]. Multiple populations of An. gambiae and An. coluzzii are represented, providing an opportunity to compare these sibling species as well as study geographical variation within species. 


However, there is a wealth of information about recent selection in the Ag1000G data that remains to be explored and systematically analysed, to identify likely candidate genes driving selection signals, and to characterise selection profiles in different populations. 


Given varied selection pressures, and given unknowns regarding molecular evolution of natural populations, valuable to leverage whole-genome sequencing data, and perform genome-wide scans for signals of recent positive selection. This hypothesis-free approach allows discovery of loci under selection. Where this occurs at genes already known play role in insecticide resistance, this can confirm important role in natural populations. Where occurs at nove loci, can provide clues about previously unknown resistance mechanisms. Also allows study of adaptive landscape in different populations, comparing species and geographical locations. Although it is known that pyrethroid resistance is widespread, not at all clear if all populations share a common set of adaptations, or whether adaptive combination varies between species and/or populations. 




Furthermore, other enzyme classes such as glutathione S-transferases may have the potential to metabolise pyrethroids




Thirdly, other classes of metabolic enzyme including glutathione S-transferases and carboxylesterases are known to be associated with insecticide resistance, but it's not clear whether pyrethroids. Fourthly, entirely new pyrethroid resistance mechanisms have recently been discovered, demonstrating that the potential range of adaptations is wide and much remains to be learned about how natural populations are evolving across the full genomic landscape.
That resistance to pyrethroids has evolved and increased in prevalence among natural populations of An. gambiae and An. coluzzii over the last two decades is well documented @@REFs. @@some summary stats on prevalence@@. The biochemical and genetic basis of this resistance has also been studied extensively. Yet there remain some surprising gaps in our knowledge of the molecular adaptations that are primarily driving physiological resistance to pyrethroids in natural populations of these mosquito species. So-called "target-site" pyrethroid resistance, driven by changes in the gene encoding the binding target of pyrethroid molecules, is known to be common in many natural populations and considered a major mode of adaptation. So-called "metabolic" pyrethroid resistance due to adaptations that affect cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes, also known as "mixed-function oxidases", are also believed to be playing an important role. Yet the relative importance of these two resistance mechanisms has been the subject of debate. Furthermore, there are at least @@N CYP genes present in the An. gambiae genome, located in several clusters found on different chromosome arms. Although a number of CYP genes have been associated with pyrethroid resistance, it is still unclear which is playing the major role in adaptation to pyrethroids in the field. 






# Paragraph on selection pressure due to pyrethroid use in LLINs


African malaria-transmitting mosquitoes have been subjected to a massive increase in the scale and scope of public health programmes aimed at malaria vector control over the past two decades (Hemingway et al. 2016; Cibulskis et al. 2016; Bhatt et al. 2015; WHO 2019). 


The dominant malaria vectors throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa are the sibling mosquito species Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles coluzzii, which are highly anthropophilic and primarily seek blood meals from humans while they sleep at night . It is reasonable to assume, therefore, that an increase in pyrethroid ITN use has created a strong selection pressure, which has driven the observed increase in the prevalence and intensity of pyrethroid resistance among natural populations of these mosquito species over the same period (Hemingway et al. 2016; Hancock et al. 2020).


how malaria vector populations from different species and geographical locations are evolving in response to our control efforts and other recent anthropogenic selection pressures. 


While some adaptations have been studied extensively both in the field and the lab, these are mostly focused on a few genetic loci, and we lack a complete and coherent genomic picture of recent evolution in major malaria vector species. Furthermore, recent selection pressures may be heterogeneous in time and space and experienced differently by different vector species. Evolutionary responses may also vary, either as a direct consequence of these differences in selection pressures, or because of stochastic processes, or both. Thus it is of both practical and scientific interest to expand studies of recent evolution to span multiple malaria vector species and geographical locations. 


inextricably intertwined with 


Surveillance of mosquito populations using bioassays has shown that physiological resistance to pyrethroids has become widespread among populations of the major malaria vector species and has increased in intensity over the same time period @@REFs. Although pyrethroid resistance has been extensively studied in the field and the lab for many years, yet there remains some unknowns and uncertainties regarding the underlying genetic changes that have driven the evolution of resistance. Clearly substitutions in the gene encoding for the voltage-gated sodium channel which is the binding target for pyrethroid insecticides, have played a key role. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes which metabolise pyrethroid insecticides and other molecules have also played a demonstrated role. Yet there are several different loci harbouring CYP genes scattered throughout the genome, several of these CYP gene loci have been associated with pyrethroid resistance, without a clear determination of which genes are playing the greatest role in adaptation in field populations.
